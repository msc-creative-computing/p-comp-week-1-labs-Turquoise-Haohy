MISSION Description...
Imagine a speculative scifi machine using only the parts from today's labs.
For inspiration, remember most of the interfaces on StarTrek are just LEDs and buttons.
Have fun with it! Make up something you think would be an interface for the future using just the skils we learned from the readings and the labs.
What affordances with a future interface considers? Who would it serve?
What would it be indicating or doing? When you are done, upload your project to your project log website.

Global citizens now are cosmetic citizens, our people and other beings live together in this vast world.
We shuttle among different glaxies. Air craft has become the formal transportation means.
We speak different language, even with different frequency.
To communicate, a new type of translator is being introduced to install in every space shuttle.
In terms of how the translator works, it could collect the sender's voices in all frequencies and transfer it to the MORSE CODE showing on the LED 
only visible to the receiver.
The lighting time of the LED corresponds to each letter, as the table below:
A	·-	B	-···	C	-·-·	D	-··	E	·	F	··-·	G	--·
H	····	I	··	J	·---	K	-·-	L	·-··	M	--	N	-·
O	---	P	·--·	Q	--·-	R	·-·	S	···	T	-	U	··-
V	···-	W	·--	X	-··-	Y	-·--	Z	--··

1	·----		2	··---  	3	···--	  4	····-		5	·····	
6	-····		7	--···		8	---··		9	----·		0	-----	
Then the receiver could choose to decypher or not and understand what the sender have said.

As showed in my exampble codes, the sender asked receiver: Do you love Kirby

Thanks!
