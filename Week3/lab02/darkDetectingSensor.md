Lab 03: Dark detecting Circuit for your pumpkins
Making a dark detecting LED (From Circuit diagram to breadboard) Build this project to better understand transistors https://makezine.com/projects/dark-detecting-led/ There is one change though, verses use a battery, we're just going to power our circuit with the Arduino 3V out.

[Here's the datasheet for the phototransistor] (https://www.avnet.com/shop/emea/products/everlight/pt333-3c-3074457345634369228?&r=EMEA&CMP=AVNET-EMEA-PPC-Google-All-English-AVE14-SKU-1699305114-66248026957-042019)

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit, or put a link to your tinkercad project you've made public on your blog. Note in Tinkercad the phototransistor here is called an Ambient Light Sensor [Phototransistor]
