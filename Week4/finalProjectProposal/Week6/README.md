# Explore the physical interactive methods
After changing the plan, I am trying to find the materials and the proper computing technics to get them realised.
I write down s series of questions to answer:

* How to make the interface? what texture?
* How to make the interface conductive and connect them to my micro controller?
* How to build the camera simulation thing?
* How to visualise my feedback figure? Hand-made or 3d printing? Is there any other way?

Firstly, I am trying to see what I can do with the MPR121, the conductive sensor:

And then I also test the conductive ink as the main conductive method to paint my interface:

And this is feasible to some extent:

I hack the internet and refer to an experience of using MPR121 and ink to make a paper piano:
